# Pascal Sommer Photography, 2017 Version

The second version of my photography blog was live from roughly January 2017 until January 2018. It already featured an admin login complete with staging area and comment overview, but still displayed all the photos on one page by appending newly loaded images at the bottom. As I'm looking back now in 2019, the amount of photos approaching 1000, this would have gotten problematic eventually. Right now it's still ok, but usability suffers because jumping far back takes forever.

Copy `config.php.example` to `config.php` and fill in the relevant credentials.
